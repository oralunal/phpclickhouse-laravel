## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- A published `config/clickhouse.php` is now actually read. The service provider only ever loaded its own bundled copy, so `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=clickhouse-config` followed by editing the file silently did nothing — including the documented way to declare a second ClickHouse connection. Precedence is now `config/database.php` > published `config/clickhouse.php` > packaged defaults.
- `insertBulk()` no longer drops the cast for the first column. `array_search()` returns index `0` for it, which the truthiness check treated as "not found", so a `boolean` cast on the first column was skipped and the raw PHP value reached ClickHouse (typically failing with `Cannot parse string 'false' as UInt8`).
- `flushBuffer()` no longer throws `Fields not match` when rows were buffered one at a time carrying the same keys in different orders. Buffered rows are reordered to the first row's key order at flush time. A row whose key *set* differs is left untouched, so a genuinely mismatched buffer still fails loudly instead of shipping fabricated column values.

### Upgrade note

- If you published `config/clickhouse.php` before this release and edited it, those edits had no effect and may have been worked around elsewhere (for example in `.env` or `config/database.php`). They now take effect, ranking above the packaged defaults and below `config/database.php`. Review the published file before deploying.

### Documentation

- Corrected the derived table name (`MyTable` resolves to `my_tables`, not `my_table`), the events section (only `create()` fires `creating`/`created`; `save()` fires just `saved`), the `InsertArray` example (`insertAssoc()` takes `column => value` rows), and the `$tableSources` comment (`UPDATE` and `TRUNCATE` target it as well).
- Added the missing `PhpClickHouseSchemaBuilder` imports to the Schema Builder migration example, which fataled when copied as written.
- Documented the `cluster_name` connection key, which `Migration::createMergeTree()` reads to emit `ON CLUSTER` and which appeared in no documentation — including the fact that it requires `->ifNotExists()`, since migrations are dispatched to each node in turn and `ON CLUSTER` already creates the table everywhere on the first dispatch.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicated internal scaffolding into shared helpers; public API and generated SQL are unchanged:
  - `Builder`: `delete()`, `update()`, and `insert()` resolve their target table through one protected `getTableForWrites()` helper (previously three copies, one with a divergent string cast).
  - `BaseModel`: `where()` and `whereRaw()` build their entry query through a shared protected static `newSourcedQuery()` helper; `select()` deliberately keeps its previous behavior (no sources table attached).
  - `Migration::createMergeTree()` reads the database name and cluster settings from the resolved `Connection` instead of re-fetching them from the global `config()` repository.
  - `WithClient::getThisClient()` now routes through `resolveConnection()`, and the deprecated static `getClient()` delegates to `getThisClient()`. For subclasses that override `resolveConnection()` or `getThisClient()`, the override now consistently applies to every client acquisition; previously some internal paths bypassed it.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- In-memory buffered inserts on `BaseModel`: `buffer()` accumulates rows per-model and `flushBuffer()` sends them to ClickHouse as a single `insertAssocBulk` HTTP request. The `$casts` pipeline used by `insertAssoc()` is reused, so cast behavior is identical. On flush failure the buffer is preserved so the caller can retry.
- Helper methods alongside the buffer API: `bufferCount()`, `getBufferedRows()`, `clearBuffer()`, and `BaseModel::flushAllBuffers()`.
- Auto-flush on script shutdown: the service provider registers a Laravel `terminating` callback plus a `register_shutdown_function` fallback for non-HTTP scripts. Errors during auto-flush are reported via `report()` rather than thrown.

### Changed

- Extracted the row-normalization + cast loop from `insertAssoc()` into a shared `prepareAssocRowsForInsert()` helper so manual and buffered inserts go through the same path. Public behavior of `insertAssoc()` is unchanged.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Package auto-discovery — the service provider registers itself via `extra.laravel.providers`, so no manual entry in `config/app.php` / `bootstrap/providers.php` is needed.
- Multi-connection support in the publishable `config/clickhouse.php`. Each entry is merged into `config('database.connections.<name>')`; user-supplied values always win.
- Unit-level test coverage for `QueryGrammar`, `SchemaGrammar`, and `Builder` SQL generation — these run without Docker / ClickHouse.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow against real ClickHouse service containers, with cluster tests gated off in CI.

### Changed

- `fix_default_query_builder` is enabled by default in the shipped config.
- Development flow migrated to **Orchestra Testbench** + `workbench/` skeleton. `vendor/bin/testbench <artisan-command>` works in the repo root, and **Laravel Boost** is wired via `composer boost`.
- Replaced the `tests.bootstrap.sh` + `bitnami/laravel` container flow with a slimmed-down `docker-compose.test.yaml` that only runs ClickHouse + Zookeeper.

### Removed

- Legacy `.travis.yml` and `.github/workflows/test.yml`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Forked from [glushkovds/phpclickhouse-laravel](https://github.com/glushkovds/phpclickhouse-laravel) at 2.5.2.
- Minimum PHP 8.5, Laravel 13+ only.
